Seit 2017 gibt es sie auch in Deutschland. Bei bunten Fahrraddemos erobern Radfahrende von 0 bis 99 Jahren die Straße.  \n> Kinder und nachhaltige Mobilität sowie lebenswerte Städte stehen im Fokus. Die Kidical Mass hat die Vision, dass sich alle Kinder und Jugendliche sicher und selbständig mit dem Fahrrad bewegen können. Sie gibt den Kindern eine Stimme im Verkehr, zeichnet ein positives Zukunftsbild, vernetzt und mobilisiert Alt und Jung über die Grenzen der Radszene hinaus.\n\n### „Platz da für die nächste Generation!“.\n\n> Beim Kidical Mass Aktionswochenende 2021 im Rahmen der Europäischen Mobilitätswoche und zum Weltkindertag wollen wir wieder an ganz vielen Orten in Deutschland, Europa und rund um den Globus für fahrrad- und kinderfreundliche Städte demonstrieren.\n\nDas Aktionsbündnis richtet folgende Forderungen an die kommende Bundesregierung:\n\n[Die Forderungen des Kidical Mass Aktionsbündnis an die neue Bundesregierung](https://kinderaufsrad.org/kidical-mass-postkarten-bundestagswahl2021/) lauten:\n\n- Sicheres Schulradwege Netz bis 2030\n- Schulstraßen und verkehrsberuhigte Bereiche vor Schulen und Kitas\n- Stetige jährliche Finanzierung mit konkreten Zielvorgaben an die Kommunen\n- Kinderfreundliches Straßenverkehrsrecht, v.a.\n    - Tempo 30 als Regelgeschwindigkeit innerorts,\n    - geschützte und baulich getrennte, breite Radwege an Hauptstraßen,\n    - Spielstraßen,\n    - Wohngebiete ohne Durchgangsverkehr,\n    - Vision Zero (null Verkehrstote)\n\n\nDem schließen wir uns an [ˆ1] und werden nächsten Sonntag, 19.09. um 14:30 Uhr mit der 3. Fahrraddemo in Hammelburg starten.  \n\nStart ist wieder der Parkplatz Bleichrasen in Hammelburg, Ziel ist der Marktplatz. \n\nDie Tour wird dieses Mal etwas länger und verschiedene Ecken von Hammelburg erreichen. Sie ist ca. 6 km lang und ist für Jung und Alt gut fahrbar. Wir fahren sowieso langsam (6-8 km/h), so dass alle gut und vor allem sicher mitfahren können.\nWir werden wie die beiden letzten Male besonders auf uns aufpassen.\nDie genaue Tour werden wir noch extra bekannt geben.\n\nGebt euren Familien, Bekannten und Freunden Bescheid, kommt und habt zusammen mit uns Spaß durch Hammelburg zu fahren und gemeinsam für ein fahrradfreundliches Hammelburg für uns und vor allem für die Kinder zu demonstrieren!\n\n[1]: Auch wenn wir in Hammelburg natürlich etwas andere Probleme haben. Die Sache bleibt dieselbe. \n",

Sogar Mallorca führt gerade Ausgangssperren ein, weil ihnen klar ist, dass es sich nicht lohnt für das vermeintliche Ostergeschäft den Schaden durch noch schneller steigende Infektions-, Krankheits- und Todeszahlen hinzunehmen.  \n\nIch verstehe nicht mal mehr, warum sie so handeln.  \nDen eigenen Arsch zu retten, Blosstellung vermeiden und sich ekelig rauswinden, scheint mir das einzige zu sein, was diesen Schlag Politiker gerade motiviert. Abgesehen von der tief sitzenden Korruption in der CDU/CSU.\n\nEiner der wenigen Lichtblicke dabei: die Chance, dass die Grünen die Kanzlerin stellen, steigt immer mehr. \n\nEin anderer Hoffnungsschimmer: Menschen beginnen sich von unten zu organisieren. Vorbei an bzw. ergänzend zu diesen verkrusteten Strukturen.  \n\nEin Beispiel, das ich seit ein paar Tagen beobachte ist [Marcus Ewald](https://twitter.com/maewald), der scheinbar rund um die Uhr dahinter ist, eine Organisation auf die Beine zu stellen, die ehrenamtliche Erstverfolger zusammenbringt, um die Kontaktverfolgung von Infizierten der Gesundheitsämter zu unterstützen.  \n\nWenn ich wieder mehr Kraft und Hoffnung habe (es wird besser), werde ich diese in meinem kleinen Ort unterstützen.\n\nAls Ersthelfer. Von unten.\n",

				"content_text": "Nachdem in unserem Landkreis Bad Kissingen der einzige sichtbare politische Beitrag zum Klimaschutz die Verhinderung von Stromtrassen vor der eigenen Haustür ist – ob berechtigt oder nicht ist ein anderes Thema – [geben die Grünen im Kreis vor was machbar ist](https://www.gruene-kg.de/nachrichten/jetzt-vor-ort-handeln-um-die-klimakrise-abzuwenden/):\n\n> Kernziel ist es bis spätestens 2030 den gesamten Energieverbrauch für Strom, Wärme und Mobilität im Landkreis zu 100 % aus erneuerbaren Energien zu decken\n\nKrasse Ansage, was? Wie soll das gehen? \n\nEs ist tatsächlich nicht mal besonders schwer, [Hans-Josef Fell](https://hans-josef-fell.de) hat das mit der [Energy Watch Group schon vor einem Jahr ausgearbeitet](https://energywatchgroup.org/100-erneuerbare-energien-im-landkreis-bad-kissingen).  \n\n> Der Ausbau für eine vollständig auf Erneuerbaren Energien beruhende Versorgung erfordert nach den Berechnungen der EWG folgende Infrastruktur im Landkreis Bad Kissingen:\n\n> * Bau von 48 Windkraftanlagen (je 5 MW), zusätzlich zu den heute 33 Anlagen mit durchschnittlich 2,5 MW.\n* Ausbau von PV-Dachanlagen von heute 58 MW auf zukünftig 200 MW und Ausbau der PV-Freiflächenanlagen von heute 36 MW auf zukünftig 413 MW.\n* Ausbau der kleineren Bio-KWK-Anlagen (Bioenergie und grüner Wasserstoff) von heute 3 MW auf zukünftig 81 MW.\n* Erhalt der gegenwärtigen Wasserkraftversorgung mit einer installierten Leistung von 1,6 MW und einer Erzeugung von etwa 5,5 MWh.\n* Ausbau der Speicherkapazitäten auf 142 MWh Batteriespeicher, 812 MWh Wärmespeicher und 2.898 MWh Wasserstoffspeicher.\n* Umstellung der Antriebe im Verkehrssektor (u.a. PKW und ÖPNV) auf elektrische Antriebe.\n\nDie Studie kann man auch [vollständig online lesen](http://energywatchgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/EWG_Regionalstudie_Bad-Kissingen.pdf).\n\nNagut, es ist nicht einfach, weil sich keiner mit Entscheidungsbefugnis dafür interessiert, genauer gesagt in die gegenläufige Richtung arbeitet. Hans-Josef hat alle Bürgermeister im Kreis und den Landrat informiert. In diesem einem Jahr gab es nur eine Rückmeldung, vom Bad Kissinger Bürgermeister: \"Schaue ich mir bei Gelegenheit mal an.\"  (sinngemäß).\n\n",

Zeigt sie euch oder zeigt sie die Handschrift einer Agentur?\n> \n> Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass der Stadtrat in Hammelburg durch einen offeneren, die Bürger einbindenden Stil, noch bessere Arbeit machen kann. Sicher, es ist aufwändig seine Argumente zu einer Entscheidung zu erklären und dann auch noch öffentlich zu verteidigen. Allerdings werden sie dadurch in sich besser und auch besser verstanden. Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass die besseren Argumente bessere Resultate liefern.\n\n– [Warum wir unsere Wahlwerbung selber machen – Junge Liste](https://www.junge-liste-hammelburg.de/2020/02/14/warum-wir-wahlwerbung-selber-machen/)\n\nAuch deswegen möchte ich auf der  [Website der Jungen Liste Hammelburg bloggen](http://www.junge-liste-hammelburg.de/blog/). Etwas Licht in das Dunkel der Vorgänge bringen, die im Stadtrat und darum stattfinden. \n\nMit diesem Artikel fange ich bei uns an.\n",
