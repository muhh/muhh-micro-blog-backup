The form factor was made for me as a mobile computer, and with its i7, it was powerful for everything I needed.  \r\nSo in autumn of last year, I wanted to try Linux again, which is why I have ordered a [Starlite Mk IV 11-inch laptop](https://de.starlabs.systems/products/starlite). This is supposed to be the mobile workstation I can throw in the bag.  \r\nI have been waiting for months now because of Covid related delays. \r\n\r\nBut for real work™, I need something more powerful, and I want it soon. I'm getting more annoyed with bugs[^1], and the stopgaps I'm confronted with because of Apple's switch to the ARM processor architecture are worse than I expected when getting the machine. Because of it, I can't use my development workflows directly on my Macbook Air[^2] but need to work remotely on Linux machines. This is ok since I work 95% in a shell and with neovim, but not all the time and exceptionally not well when I want to sit in the garden (office).  \r\n\r\nSo, I need a powerful desktop running Linux to complement the tiny portable one.\r\n\r\nI'd love to order something from [tuxedo computers](http://tuxedocomputers.com/) – [Jochen](https://www.geewiz.dev/2022/01/04/new-year-new.html) has one from them, and seems to be very happy about it – but their online store has been down for days now. \r\n\r\nEven building my desktop isn’t out of the question either. I have done this a lot and always enjoyed it. I already have done some research and need to put the parts together, but I’m not fully decided yet.\r\n\r\nBut I will decide soon.\r\n \r\n\r\n[^1]: Is it so hard to remember background images with multiple displays? \r\n[^2]: Not as nice as my 2010 11“ Macbook Air, but a great machine nonetheless.\n",

Not 100% perfect, but I'm satisfied nevertheless.\r\n\r\nI only struggle to keep my hands off of Twitter. Sometimes it is just too easy to get lost there. Mostly because of the good people over there.  \r\nFacebook and Instagram on the other hand, I don't miss them much and I only did one or two occasional checks. \r\n\r\nI'm going to get strict again and try not to visit any of these sites, but I already reactivated cross-posting to [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/muhh) again and will check replies.   \r\nI subscribed to them using the [Twitter integration of NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/help/mac/6.1/en/twitter-feeds).  This is an excellent feature that removes almost all of the distraction capacity of the bird page and reduces tweets to the absolute minimum.\r\n\r\nSo let's see how the next week of this journey continues.\n",

				"content_text": "> Das sollten die Wähler*innen wissen, die jetzt in ihrer eigenen Bräsigkeit wie immer CDU wählen wollen, weil man sich sicher sein kann, dass dann im richtigen Moment schon das richtige passieren wird: dafür steht Laschet nicht. Er steht für das weiter so, das süße Nichtstun, und das nicht mal aus dem Glauben heraus, damit das richtige zu tun, sondern einfach aus der blanken Angst etwas falsch zu machen. Wer nichts tut, begeht auch keine Fehler, ein Grundsatz, der uns während der Pandemie einige Menschenleben gekostet hat. Und bei Laschet ist er gepaart mit der Überheblichkeit, er werde schon das richtige tun, weil sonst wäre er ja nicht Ministerpräsident/Bundeskanzler whatsoever geworden. Deckt man diese Muster auf, flippt er gleich völlig aus. So einen Menschen will niemand wählen. So einen Mann sollte niemand wählen.\n\n[Die unerträgliche Bräsigkeit des Armin Laschet und seiner Partei - Couchblog](https://couchblog.de/blog/2021/07/16/die-unertraegliche-braesigkeit-des-armin-laschet-und-seiner-partei/)\n",
